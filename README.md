# AAI521_LisaTrafficSign
This project aims to perform automatic detection and recognition of traffic road signs. The project analyzes images and labels of road signs like Stop signs, pedestrian crossings, or speed limits and aims to recognize American types of road signs.

#Dataset Analysis

The LISA Road sign dataset published by Roboflow. is used for traffic detection. Roboflow publishes datasets in various formats, including YOLO, XML, JSON, and TFRecord.

### Image augmentation

Open CV uses the following preprocessing techniques to augment images
•	Histogram Equalization
•	CLAHE 
•	Image Sharpening 
•	Denoising

# Conclusion

1. Traffic sign detection ended with a mean average precision score of 87.8% with 50% IOU threshold.
2. Use GAN for image augmentation
3. Train on additional diverse datasets beyond LISA 
4. Train on additional architectures like RETINET, Faster-CNN
5. Implement Pedestrian/Lane detection 
6. Optimize hyperparameters
7. Employ methods for more efficient training and memory optimization
